Classic Arcade Game
===================

## Description

An arcade game based on the classic 'Frogger'. This is the 3rd project created for the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree course.

## How to Play

* The object of the game is to move the character from its starting place, across the path of oncoming bugs to the safety of the water on the opposite side.

* Each time you reach the water, **10** points are added to your score and the character resets its position.

* If you collect a gem on the way to reaching the water, **20** points are added to the score.

* Being hit by a bug reduces your score by **10** points and returns the character to its starting position.

### Movement

Move the character using the arrow keys on your keyboard.
